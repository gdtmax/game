My title will be Tank War Game
TODO:My final project is mainly using Pygame model to create Tank War Game. The code is about 1000 lines, which is too long, but it is completed.

TODO: First, I use several models like Pygame, system, and random. Because this is a game, I have to create a screen and define the size of screen from width and longth and words.
After that, I will define the wizard group and add all brick wall instance objects to it. Then call the initialization method, so as to realize the necessary initialization operation. 
The purpose of defining elf groups is to define various types, such as bullet types, tank types, scene types and so on.

TODO: I use pycharm to make and debug the game. The final result should be to choose to start the game after running the program. 
At this time, players can control the direction of tanks by controlling the front, back, left and right sides. 
At this time, the enemy will also have tanks attacking our base camp constantly. What needs to be done is to guard the base camp and then destroy the enemy tanks.

TODO:No matter what happens, I can open the game and let everyone see the results of my program. But the game experience may be poor, such as no background music, rough picture and some bugs.
TODO:The best outcome would be a good game experience, after see my game, many players will think it would be a good game.

TODO: My next step is going to finish some more detailed things. For example I am going to use if statement to judge more possbility for the game like the directions of tanks, and 
also I will set the game background. Eventually the game will be tested whether it can run.
